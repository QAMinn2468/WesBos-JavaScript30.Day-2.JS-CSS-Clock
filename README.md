Wes Bos Course: JavaScript 30: Using JS to pull date info


I tweaked the CSS styling.  Second hand is now red, Hour hand is thicker, Min and Sec hands are thinner.  They are minor edits, but improve the readability of the clock allowing the user to read the time more quickly.

I was able to do the minute and hour hands on my own after watching his demo of the second hand.
